Tutorials
=========
    
In this section, we provide tutorials for Perturbo postprocessing. For each tutorial, we first must perform a Perturbo calculation, described `here <https://perturbo-code.github.io/mydoc_running_perturbo.html>`_. Perturbo offers several different *calculation modes*, which each compute different properties of a material. Each Perturbopy tutorials describes how to process the outputs of a particular calculation mode. 

We follow the tutorials on the Perturbo website to explain how to process the results of different calculations. Perturbo calculations output results as a YAML file, which is used as an input to Perturbopy. For details on how information is stored in the YAML files, see (link). The Perturbo input files 

Tutorials are given for each Perturbo calculation mode:
