#
# The Perturbo tests are organized by corresponding epwan HDF5 files: 
# epwan1, epwan2, etc.
# Each epwan file has a set of tests associated with it. 
# Each test has a correspoding folder, the foldername is made in the following way:
# epwan<n>-<testname>, where n is the index of the epwan file 
# and <testname> is a name of a given test.
